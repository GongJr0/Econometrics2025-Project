\begin{abstract}
This paper presents an autoregressive model of Real GDP with exogenous regressors that are connected to output in the Keynesian framework.
A relatively standard/conventional statistical test suite is augmented with newly discovered modifications to the Kolmogorov--Smirnov test to facilitate time-series data and the interdependece brought by it.
Building on the original validation methods that are rigorously tested over the decades, the paper manages to present moderate evidence that the estimator specified is efficient, well conditioned, and interpretable.
