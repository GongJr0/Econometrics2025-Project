\section{Methodology}\label{sec:methodology}

The proposed methodology of this paper can be split into four main components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Data Preparation
    \item Model Specification
    \item Model Estimation 
    \item BLUE Evaluation
\end{itemize}

Each component is detailed in the following subsections.

\subsection{Data Preparation}\label{subsec:data_prep}
As detailed in Section \ref{sec:data} the model uses three time series sourced from FRED.
