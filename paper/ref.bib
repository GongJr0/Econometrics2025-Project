	abstract = {This paper focuses on estimation of shives(wide) and fiber length in RGP82CD-refiners using an AutoRegressive eXogenous (ARX) structure in a data-driven soft sensor concept. Both external and internal variables are considered as model inputs. The pulp properties were sampled every 15 min from an on-line device positioned after the latency chest, whereas other process data were sampled every 6 seconds. Notably, despite the high data sampling rate, the development of robust models necessitated a dataset spanning over two months of process information. The external variables studied in this paper were specific energy, the sawmill chip content, plate gaps, and dilution water feed rates to each refining zone. Additional internal variables, such as the inlet flat zone temperature, the maximum temperature, and the periphery temperature in the conical zone, were also used as model inputs. It was concluded that both shives(wide) and fiber length can be estimated with relatively good accuracy although large uncertainties exist in the measured properties. Finally, it was shown that fast pulp property dynamics in the blow-line can be followed, which outperforms current practices of using pulp measurement devices positioned after the latency chest. This offers implementation of more advanced future pulp property control concepts.},

This paper investigates the impact of climate change risks on residential consumption and the heterogeneous effects of different climate risk types in China by an ARMAX model and examines the Granger causality between them. Empirical results based on monthly data from January 2016 to January 2019 suggest a significant positive effect of climate change risks on residential consumption, but with a three-month lag period. If the climate risk index increases by 1 unit, residential consumption will increase by 1.29\% after three months. Additionally, the impact of climate change risks on residential consumption in China mainly comes from drought, waterlogging by rain, and high temperature, whereas the impact of typhoons and cryogenic freezing is not significant. Finally, we confirmed the existence of Granger-causality running from climate change risks to residential consumption. Our findings establish the linkage between climate change risks and residential consumption and have some practical implications for the government in tackling climate change risks.},

Since the asymptotic null distribution of this statistic depends on the unknown law of the data, P-values and critical values for the test are estimated by means of a symmetric sieve bootstrap procedure based on residual resampling from an autoregressive approximation to the given process. The small-sample performance of the sieve bootstrap test is assessed by means of Monte Carlo experiments, which show that the test performs satisfactorily in terms of null rejection rates and power, although it does tend to be somewhat conservative for time series of relatively short length.},

The dependence of both the finite sample and the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic on the dependence structure of the data requires the use of the wild bootstrap technique for inference. The related wild bootstrap test turns out to be a consistent asymptotically level α test. With the finite sample correction applied, the test keeps the level well. An extensive simulation study demonstrates good finite sample behaviour of the test in comparison to the existing procedures. The main role in the proofs is played by tools from empirical processes. Additional simulation results, as well as an R code, which allow one to easily repeat the conducted numerical experiments, are attached as Supplementary Material.},

	abstract = {The Kolmogorov--Smirnov (KS) test is a widely used statistical test that assesses the conformity of a sample to a specified distribution. Its efficacy, however, diminishes with serially dependent data and when parameters within the hypothesized distribution are unknown. For independent data, parametric and nonparametric bootstrap procedures are available to adjust for estimated parameters. For serially dependent stationary data, parametric bootstrap has been developed with a working serial dependence structure. A counterpart for the nonparametric bootstrap approach, which needs a bias correction, has not been studied. Addressing this gap, our study introduces a bias correction method employing a nonparametric block bootstrap, which approximates the distribution of the KS statistic in assessing the goodness-of-fit of the marginal distribution of a stationary series, accounting for unspecified serial dependence and unspecified parameters. We assess its effectiveness through simulations, scrutinizing both its size and power. The practicality of our method is further illustrated with an examination of stock returns from the S{\textbackslash}\&P 500 index, showcasing its utility in real-world applications.},
