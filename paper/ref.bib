	abstract = {This paper focuses on estimation of shives(wide) and fiber length in RGP82CD-refiners using an AutoRegressive eXogenous (ARX) structure in a data-driven soft sensor concept. Both external and internal variables are considered as model inputs. The pulp properties were sampled every 15 min from an on-line device positioned after the latency chest, whereas other process data were sampled every 6 seconds. Notably, despite the high data sampling rate, the development of robust models necessitated a dataset spanning over two months of process information. The external variables studied in this paper were specific energy, the sawmill chip content, plate gaps, and dilution water feed rates to each refining zone. Additional internal variables, such as the inlet flat zone temperature, the maximum temperature, and the periphery temperature in the conical zone, were also used as model inputs. It was concluded that both shives(wide) and fiber length can be estimated with relatively good accuracy although large uncertainties exist in the measured properties. Finally, it was shown that fast pulp property dynamics in the blow-line can be followed, which outperforms current practices of using pulp measurement devices positioned after the latency chest. This offers implementation of more advanced future pulp property control concepts.},

This paper investigates the impact of climate change risks on residential consumption and the heterogeneous effects of different climate risk types in China by an ARMAX model and examines the Granger causality between them. Empirical results based on monthly data from January 2016 to January 2019 suggest a significant positive effect of climate change risks on residential consumption, but with a three-month lag period. If the climate risk index increases by 1 unit, residential consumption will increase by 1.29\% after three months. Additionally, the impact of climate change risks on residential consumption in China mainly comes from drought, waterlogging by rain, and high temperature, whereas the impact of typhoons and cryogenic freezing is not significant. Finally, we confirmed the existence of Granger-causality running from climate change risks to residential consumption. Our findings establish the linkage between climate change risks and residential consumption and have some practical implications for the government in tackling climate change risks.},

The dependence of both the finite sample and the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic on the dependence structure of the data requires the use of the wild bootstrap technique for inference. The related wild bootstrap test turns out to be a consistent asymptotically level α test. With the finite sample correction applied, the test keeps the level well. An extensive simulation study demonstrates good finite sample behaviour of the test in comparison to the existing procedures. The main role in the proofs is played by tools from empirical processes.

Its efficacy, however, diminishes with serially dependent data and when parameters within the hypothesized distribution are unknown. For independent data, parametric and nonparametric bootstrap procedures are available to adjust for estimated parameters. For serially dependent stationary data, parametric bootstrap has been developed with a working serial dependence structure. A counterpart for the nonparametric bootstrap approach, which needs a bias correction, has not been studied. Addressing this gap, our study introduces a bias correction method employing a nonparametric block bootstrap, which approximates the distribution of the KS statistic in assessing the goodness-of-fit of the marginal distribution of a stationary series, accounting for unspecified serial dependence and unspecified parameters. We assess its effectiveness through simulations, scrutinizing both its size and power. The practicality of our method is further illustrated with an examination of stock returns from the S{\textbackslash}\&P 500 index, showcasing its utility in real-world applications.},

Moreover, we propose a variety of forecast combinations to arrive at the highest possible forecast accuracy. Our estimation sample starts in the first quarter of 2003, and our evaluation period ranges from the second quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2017. We find that higher-frequency indicators contain useful information for predicting current economic activity in most of the economies in our sample. Using forecast combinations of models with and without higher-frequency variables yields additional gains in predictive accuracy. The best performers ultimately selected vary strongly across countries: we find 10 different models for 11 countries. Eight country models produce a statistically significantly smaller forecast error than the benchmark. Calculating a CESEE-11 country aggregate based on the individual country forecasts yields a forecast performance that is highly superior to that of the benchmark.},

	abstract = {Ten years ago we presented a modified version of Okun law for the biggest developed economies and reported its excellent predictive power. In this study, we revisit the original models using the estimates of real GDP per capita and unemployment rate between 2010 and 2019. The initial results show that the change in unemployment rate can be accurately predicted by variations in the rate of real economic growth. There is a discrete version of the model which is represented by a piece wise linear dependence of the annual increment in unemployment rate on the annual rate of change in real GDP per capita. The lengths of the country-dependent time segments are defined by breaks in the GDP measurement units associated with definitional revisions to the nominal GDP and GDP deflator (dGDP). The difference between the CPI and dGDP indices since the beginning of measurements reveals the years of such breaks. Statistically, the link between the studied variables in the revised models is characterized by the coefficient of determination in the range from R2=0.866 (Australia) to R2=0.977 (France). The residual errors can be likely associated with the measurement errors, e.g. the estimates of real GDP per capita from various sources differ by tens of percent. The obtained results confirm the original finding on the absence of structural unemployment in the studied developed countries.},

	abstract = {Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and unemployment rate are two key figures to determine a country’s degree of prosperity. High unemployment rate shows that the labor availability is not used efficiently. This paper observes the correlation between the Gross Domestic Product and the unemployment rate in the U.S. - over a long period of time, i.e. 50 years. By using an econometric model we run multiple regression analysis to test our hypothesis that is that a decreasing GDP rate through slow economic growth leads to an increasing unemployment rate. Supported by a review of relevant literature we discover a continuously existing negative correlation between the GDP and the unemployment in the U.S. over the last fifty years.},

	abstract = {This panel analysis study is conducted to examine the relationship between inflation rates (CPI) and unemployment rates (HUR) with the Gross Domestic Product growth rates (GDP), before and after the 2008 European crisis. Quarterly data for 18 consecutive years and six sample countries from Europe (Austria, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary and United Kingdom) have been considered in the panel. In order to get a more profound understanding of the impacts of the European crisis on the relationship between the variables, the panel data set has been classified into 3 separate panels, such that Panel 1 (1999Q1-2007Q4) represents before-crisis panel, Panel 2 (2008Q1-2016Q4) represents the during/after crisis panel and lastly, Panel 3 (1999Q1-2016Q4) represents the long-run panel. Panel 1 is subject to the Fixed Effects with LSDV model, whereby four out of the six countries are significant, and CPI and HUR are insignificant predictors of the GDP. Both Panel 2 and Panel 3 are subject to the Two-way Random Effects model, whereby both CPI and HUR have negative significant effect on GDP. Granger Causality test has also been carried out to determine whether causality is present among variables, based on each panel.},

	abstract = {In the 21st century, the increasing complexity and uncertainty of the global economy have heightened the need for accurate economic forecasting. Per capita GDP, a critical indicator of living standards, economic growth, and productivity, plays a key role in government policy-making, corporate strategy, and investor decisions. However, predicting per capita GDP poses significant challenges due to its sensitivity to various economic and social factors. Traditional methods such as statistical analysis, regression, and time-series models have shown limitations in capturing nonlinear interactions and volatility of economic data. To address these limitations, this study develops a per capita GDP forecasting model based on deep learning, incorporating key macroeconomic variables—the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and unemployment rate (UR)—to enhance predictive accuracy. This study employs five deep-learning regression models (RNN, LSTM, GRU, TCN, and Transformer) applied to real and placebo datasets, each incorporating combinations of CPI and UR. The results demonstrate that deep learning models can effectively capture complex, nonlinear relationships in economic data, significantly improving predictive accuracy compared to traditional models. Among the models, the Transformer consistently achieves the highest R-squared and lowest error values across various metrics (MSE, RMSE, and MSLE), indicating its superior ability to model intricate economic patterns. In addition, including CPI and UR as additional predictors enhances model robustness, with the TCN and Transformer models showing particularly strong performance in capturing short-term economic fluctuations. The findings suggest that the deep learning models, especially the Transformer, offer valuable tools for policymakers and business leaders, providing reliable GDP forecasts that support economic decision-making, resource allocation, and strategic planning. Academically, this study advances the understanding of deep learning applications in economic forecasting, particularly in integrating significant macroeconomic variables for enhanced predictive performance. The developed model is a foundation for informed economic policy and strategic decisions, offering a robust and actionable framework for managing economic uncertainties. This research contributes to theoretical and applied economics, providing insights that bridge academic innovation with practical utility in economic forecasting.},

	url = {https://ideas.repec.org//p/arx/papers/2005.08735.html},
	abstract = {This paper selects the NARX neural network as the method through literature review, and constructs specific NARX neural networks under application scenarios involving macroeconomic forecasting, national goal setting and global competitiveness assessment. Through case studies on China, US and Eurozone, this study explores how those limited \& partial exogenous inputs or abundant \& comprehensive exogenous inputs, a small set of most relevant exogenous inputs or a large set of exogenous inputs covering all major aspects of the macro economy, whole area related exogenous inputs or both whole area and subdivision area related exogenous inputs specifically affect the forecasting performance of NARX neural networks for specific macroeconomic indicators or indices. Through the case study on Russia this paper explores how the limited \& most relevant exogenous inputs set or the abundant \& comprehensive exogenous inputs set specifically influences the prediction performance of those specific NARX neural networks for national goal setting. Finally, comparative studies on the application of NARX neural networks for the forecasts of Global Competitiveness Indices (GCIs) of various economies are conducted, in order to explore whether the specific NARX neural network trained on the basis of the GCI related data of some economies can make sufficiently accurate predictions about GCIs of other economies, and whether the specific NARX neural network trained on the basis of the data of some type of economies can give more accurate predictions about GCIs of the same type of economies than those of different type of economies. Based on all of the above successful application, this paper provides policy recommendations on applying fully trained NARX neural networks that are assessed as qualified to assist or even replace the deductive and inductive abilities of the human brain in a variety of appropriate tasks.},
